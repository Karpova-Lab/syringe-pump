## Features
- Infuse and retract capable syringe pump
- Frame is made of lasercut parts and standard hardware
- Small footprint (330 mm x 140 mm x 100 mm). Can be mounted vertically or set on surface
- Cost ~ $200
- Assembly time ~30 minutes
- Linear resolution = 2.5 µm. Volume resolution with 60mL syringe is 1.4 µL

- Motor controller includes color display and joystick/buttons for manual control

## Background

The goal of this project is to provide an easy to assemble, open-source syringe pump that is significantly less expensive than commercial pumps, while maintaining a sufficient level of dispense resolution and repeatability.
