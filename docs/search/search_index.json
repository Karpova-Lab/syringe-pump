A 7-pin female header socket provides access to the bipolar stepper motor and two limit switches.</p> <p>Dispensing liquid from a syringe pump requires precise control of stepper motor's rotation. Typically, this involves having some control software running on a computer communicate to a microcontroller...</p> <ul> <li>when to rotate</li> <li>which direction to rotate</li> <li>how far to rotate</li> <li>how fast rotate</li> </ul> <p>The microcontroller calculates the quantity and timing of partial rotations (steps) that will produce the intended motor movement. This collection of precisely timed step signals is fed into a stepper motor driver IC, which in turn supplies current to motor coils in a sequence that creates a rotating magnetic field, causing the motor shaft to incrementally rotate (here is a good video for more information on how hybrid stepper motors work).</p> <p>Multiple options exist for each element in the technology stack (control software + microcontroller + stepper driver IC), thereby creating many possibilities for controlling a syringe pump. For example, these three neuroscience labs developed the following solutions:</p> Project Software Development Board (Microcontroller) Stepper Driver Poulet Lab Bpod motor controller Bpod Teensy 3.6 (MK66FX) TMC2100 Pachter Lab Poseidon System Poseidon Controller Arduino Uno (ATMEGA328) DRV8825 Karpova Lab SCB for pyControl pyControl Feather M0 equivalent (ATSAMD21) TMC2209 <p>The existence of these multiple solutions highlights the importance of the syringe pump not being tied to a specific technology stack.  The pump can benefit more users since the control electronics are decoupled from the rest of the syringe pump.  One can easily swap in their own electronics to integrate the pump with their particular setup. No more vendor lock-in! You should be able to use your syringe pumps with whatever system you choose.  If a cool new display or better motor driver IC becomes available, upgrading the electronics should be an easy swap.</p> <p>Community Designs</p> <p>Do you have ideas for a custom control board? A design that you've already built?  Consider sharing in the discussions for others to benefit from.  I can add community design links and information to this documentation page!</p> <p>To ensure compatibility with the existing baseplate, your PCB should include a 7-pin header and a mounting hole (refer to the pyControl SCB layout below for dimensions).  </p>"},{"location":"electronics/#pycontrol-syringe-control-board-scb","title":"pyControl Syringe Control Board (SCB)","text":"<p>In our lab we designed a motor controller that interfaces with pyControl.
