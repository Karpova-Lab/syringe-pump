The previous sentence will not apply to any Claim that is determined with finality by a court of competent jurisdiction to result solely from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of an HHMI Indemnitee. Notwithstanding any other provision of this agreement, your obligation to defend, indemnify and hold harmless the HHMI Indemnitees under this paragraph will not be subject to any limitation or exclusion of liability or damages or otherwise limited in any way.  This provision shall survive any termination or expiration of this agreement.
